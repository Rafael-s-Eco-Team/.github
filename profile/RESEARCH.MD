## Life Plant
### Potassium
Potassium is associated with the movement of water, nutrients and carbohydrates in plant tissue. It's involved with enzyme activation within the plant, which affects protein, starch and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The production of ATP can regulate the rate of photosynthesis.
### Phosphourus Cycle
The phosphorus cycle is the biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
### Nitrogen
Nitrogen plays a critical role within the plant to ensure energy is available when and where the plant needs it to optimize yield. This crucial nutrient is even present in the roots as proteins and enzymes help regulate water and nutrient uptake.
### Urea (chemical compound of nitrogen)
Urea, also known as carbamide, is a safe, useful compound with a significant history. It is a naturally occurring molecule that is produced by protein metabolism and found abundantly in mammalian urine.
### Converting urine to urea and phosphourus

### Nitric Acid Creation Process
1. Produce hydrogen by producing an electric current through water.
2. Combine said hydrogen with nitrogen to create ammonia.
3. Combine ammonia with oxygen to make nitrogen oxide.
4. Combine nitrogen oxide with air to make nitrogen dioxide.
5. Combine nitrogen dioxide with water to make nitric acid.
### Considerations
To get nitrogen for making ammonia, we might team up with universities who have already done this to be given this ntriogen/nitrate.
### Alternative for nitric acid

Warning!

This compound schould not mixed with : nitrogen compound and HCl this compound is very corrosive to human tissu and at high consentration can make fire with organic.
If you arrent experienced with oxidizer , dont do this. NEVER mix it with something that you dont know the product of reaction.

Precaussion for improuvement:
when you synthesis make sure that NO chloride salt is present , So dont think using Calcium Hypochlorite instaid , ive ear that Lithium hypochlorite could substitute the Sodium hypochlorite , this could be an improuvement

Reagent:
10% NaOCl Pool industry grade
H2SO4 98% ACS Reagent
H2O Distiled
CHCl3 Triple distilled
Experimental

Take 14.9g of 10% NaOCl and ad it to and Round Bottom Boiling Flask .Instal an bubler trough 5ml of CHCl3 in a test tube , witch will be cooled in HCl snow mixture to The Trichloromethane layer ad 4 g of distilld water. Ad to the RBF 12g of H2SO4 (the real molar ratio is 0.98g but it need more tho hydrolise the HOCl). After 5min of seting heat the mixture(keep the temperature to 50-65 degree C) , stop when white fume evolve.

This is suposed to hapen:
2NaOCL + H2SO4 -) Na2SO4 + 2HOCl
but with ot temp the H2SO4 hydrolise the HOCl:
2HOCl-) H2O + Cl2O
the Cl2O is a gas , it will disolve in the 5ml of distill water to make HOCl , some peaple will probably think that it will disproportionnate to Cl2 , but this appen just in the presense of Cloride ion.

This also appen:
2CHCl3 + Cl2O -) 2CCl4 + H2O



You will get about 15ml of 5-6% HOCl.

futur improuvement and note: better source of hypochlorite ion , better setup , better cooling.H2SO4 can be substitued with H3PO4 Or citric acid , the last one being the best but i have only 25g of it.

the mode of opperation of the acid is this:

2HOCl + 2Cu -) CuCl2 + CuO + H2O

Other interessing compound :
Peracetic acid
