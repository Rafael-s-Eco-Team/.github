## Life Plant
### Potassium
Potassium is associated with the movement of water, nutrients and carbohydrates in plant tissue. It's involved with enzyme activation within the plant, which affects protein, starch and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The production of ATP can regulate the rate of photosynthesis.
### Phosphourus Cycle
The phosphorus cycle is the biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
### Nitrogen
Nitrogen plays a critical role within the plant to ensure energy is available when and where the plant needs it to optimize yield. This crucial nutrient is even present in the roots as proteins and enzymes help regulate water and nutrient uptake.
### Urea (chemical compound of nitrogen)
Urea, also known as carbamide, is a safe, useful compound with a significant history. It is a naturally occurring molecule that is produced by protein metabolism and found abundantly in mammalian urine.
### Converting urine to urea and phosphourus
See first link on Important Links section.
### Nitric Acid Creation Process
1. Produce hydrogen by producing an electric current through water.
2. Combine said hydrogen with nitrogen to create ammonia.
3. Combine ammonia with oxygen to make nitrogen oxide.
4. Combine nitrogen oxide with air to make nitrogen dioxide.
5. Combine nitrogen dioxide with water to make nitric acid.
### Considerations
To get nitrogen for making ammonia, we might team up with universities who have already done this to be given this ntriogen/nitrate.
