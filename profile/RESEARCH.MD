## Life Plant
### Potassium
Potassium is associated with the movement of water, nutrients and carbohydrates in plant tissue. It's involved with enzyme activation within the plant, which affects protein, starch and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The production of ATP can regulate the rate of photosynthesis.
### Phosphourus Cycle
The phosphorus cycle is the biogeochemical cycle that describes the movement of phosphorus through the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere.
### Nitrogen
Nitrogen plays a critical role within the plant to ensure energy is available when and where the plant needs it to optimize yield. This crucial nutrient is even present in the roots as proteins and enzymes help regulate water and nutrient uptake.
### Urea (chemical compound of nitrogen)
Urea, also known as carbamide, is a safe, useful compound with a significant history. It is a naturally occurring molecule that is produced by protein metabolism and found abundantly in mammalian urine.

### Nitric Acid Creation Process
1. Produce hydrogen by producing an electric current through water.
2. Combine said hydrogen with nitrogen to create ammonia.
3. Combine ammonia with oxygen to make nitrogen oxide.
4. Combine nitrogen oxide with air to make nitrogen dioxide.
5. Combine nitrogen dioxide with water to make nitric acid.
### Considerations
To get nitrogen for making ammonia, we might team up with universities who have already done this to be given this ntriogen/nitrate, OR, we can use an alternative for nitric acid, as written below.

How to Make Dilute HClO Inexpensively:

1. Add Vinegar to Bleach (NaClO) and heat to drive off mostly Cl2O, chlorine monoxide the anhydride of HClO.

2. Use Seltzer water (H2CO3) to NaClO in place of acetic acid. Wait for at least a day, and proceed as above. The chemistry is:

NaClO + H2CO3 = NaHCO3 + HClO

3. Dissolve Cl2O in water:

Cl2O + H2O = 2HClO

where Cl2O is reputedly created by passing Cl2 into KOH. Note, I have not attempted this method which is mentioned in some earlier chemistry text.

Note, only dilute solutions of HClO are stable. HClO readily decomposes especially if concentrated with the dominant reaction as follows:

3 HClO = HClO3 + 3 HCl

This is an important point as you may be producing some chlorates unknowingly. Solutions and the dry salt of Ammonium Chlorate (and heavy metals), for example, should be particularly avoided given there, at times, sensitive and highly explosive behavior.

To are lesser degree, pure HClO will decompose as follows:

2 HClO = 2 HCl + O2

however, in the presence for example of H2O2, CuO, CoO and organic material, the release of O2 is accelerated. Also, in the presence of HCl, there is an equilibrium reaction producing chlorine water:

HCl + HClO <==> H2O + Cl2

Heat and light are know to increase the rate of HClO decomposition for both reactions noted.
